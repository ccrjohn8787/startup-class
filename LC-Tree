Palindrome pairs
Maximal rectangle
Remove duplicate letters: 
  Given a string which contains only lowercase letters, remove duplicate letters so that every letter appear once and only once. 
You must make sure your result is the smallest in lexicographical order among all possible results.
Create maximum number
  Given two arrays of length m and n with digits 0-9 representing two numbers. Create the maximum number of length k <= m + n from digits of the two. The relative order of the digits from the same array must be preserved. 
  Return an array of the k digits. You should try to optimize your time and space complexity.

Substring concaternation of all words
Shortest word distance I, II, III
  Given a list of words and two words word1 and word2, return the shortest distance between these two words in the list. word1 != word2
  2. your method will be called repeatedly many times with different parameters. How would you optimize it?
  3. word1 can equal to word2
Strobogrammatic number I, II, III
  Write a function to determine if a number is strobogrammatic
  Find all strobogrammatic numbers that are of length = n.
  A strobogrammatic number is a number that looks the same when rotated 180 degrees (looked at upside down).
  Write a function to count the total strobogrammatic numbers that exist in the range of low <= num <= high.
