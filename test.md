Strobogrammatic Number II:
A strobogrammatic number is a number that looks the same when rotated 180 degrees (looked at upside down).

Find all strobogrammatic numbers that are of length = n.

For example,
Given n = 2, return ["11","69","88","96"].



Strobogrammatic Number III:
A strobogrammatic number is a number that looks the same when rotated 180 degrees (looked at upside down).

Write a function to count the total strobogrammatic numbers that exist in the range of low <= num <= high.

For example,
Given low = "50", high = "100", return 3. Because 69, 88, and 96 are three strobogrammatic numbers.

Note:
Because the range might be a large number, the low and high numbers are represented as string.




Word pattern 2:
Given a pattern and a string str, find if str follows the same pattern.

Here follow means a full match, such that there is a bijection between a letter in pattern and a non-empty substring in str.

Examples:
pattern = "abab", str = "redblueredblue" should return true.
pattern = "aaaa", str = "asdasdasdasd" should return true.
pattern = "aabb", str = "xyzabcxzyabc" should return false.


Smallest rectangle enclosing black pixels:
An image is represented by a binary matrix with 0 as a white pixel and 1 as a black pixel. The black pixels are connected, i.e., there is only one black region. Pixels are connected horizontally and vertically. Given the location (x, y) of one of the black pixels, return the area of the smallest (axis-aligned) rectangle that encloses all black pixels.

For example, given the following image:

[
  "0010",
  "0110",
  "0100"
]
and x = 0, y = 2,
Return 6.

Range query sum 2D
Given a 2D matrix matrix, find the sum of the elements inside the rectangle defined by its upper left corner (row1, col1) and lower right corner (row2, col2).
The matrix is only modifiable by the update function.
You may assume the number of calls to update and sumRegion function is distributed evenly.
You may assume that row1 ≤ row2 and col1 ≤ col2.


Closest Binary search Tree Value II:
Given a non-empty binary search tree and a target value, find k values in the BST that are closest to the target.
Note:
Given target value is a floating point.
You may assume k is always valid, that is: k ≤ total nodes.
You are guaranteed to have only one unique set of k values in the BST that are closest to the target.
Follow up:
Assume that the BST is balanced, could you solve it in less than O(n) runtime (where n = total nodes)?


Containing Duplicate
Given an array of integers, find if the array contains any duplicates. Your function should return true if any value appears at least twice in the array, and it should return false if every element is distinct.

Containing Duplicate II
Given an array of integers and an integer k, find out whether there are two distinct indices i and j in the array such that nums[i] = nums[j] and the difference between i and j is at most k.

Containing Duplicate III
Given an array of integers, find out whether there are two distinct indices i and j in the array such that the difference between nums[i] and nums[j] is at most t and the difference between i and j is at most k.
