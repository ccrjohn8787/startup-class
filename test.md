1. Self crossing
You are given an array x of n positive numbers. You start at point (0,0) and moves x[0] metres to the north, 
then x[1] metres to the west, x[2] metres to the south, x[3] metres to the east and so on. 
In other words, after each move your direction changes counter-clockwise.
Write a one-pass algorithm with O(1) extra space to determine, if your path crosses itself, or not.

3. Verify Preorder Serialization of a Binary Tree
One way to serialize a binary tree is to use pre-order traversal. When we encounter a non-null node, we record the node's value. If it is a null node, we record using a sentinel value such as #.
Given a string of comma separated values, verify whether it is a correct preorder traversal serialization of a binary tree. Find an algorithm without reconstructing the tree.
Each comma separated value in the string must be either an integer or a character '#' representing null pointer.
You may assume that the input format is always valid, for example it could never contain two consecutive commas such as "1,,3".

4. Patching Array
Given a sorted positive integer array nums and an integer n, add/patch elements to the array such that any number in range [1, n] inclusive can be formed by the sum of some elements in the array. Return the minimum number of patches required.
Example 1:
nums = [1, 3], n = 6
Return 1.
Combinations of nums are [1], [3], [1,3], which form possible sums of: 1, 3, 4.
Now if we add/patch 2 to nums, the combinations are: [1], [2], [3], [1,3], [2,3], [1,2,3].
Possible sums are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, which now covers the range [1, 6].
So we only need 1 patch.

5. Odd Even Linked List
Given a singly linked list, group all odd nodes together followed by the even nodes. Please note here we are talking about the node number and not the value in the nodes.
You should try to do it in place. The program should run in O(1) space complexity and O(nodes) time complexity.

6. Power of Three
Given an integer, write a function to determine if it is a power of three.

7. Coin Change
You are given coins of different denominations and a total amount of money amount. Write a function to compute the fewest number of coins that you need to make up that amount. If that amount of money cannot be made up by any combination of the coins, return -1.

8. Buld Switcher
There are n bulbs that are initially off. You first turn on all the bulbs. Then, you turn off every second bulb. On the third round, you toggle every third bulb (turning on if it's off or turning off if it's on). For the ith round, you toggle every i bulb. For the nth round, you only toggle the last bulb. Find how many bulbs are on after n rounds.
Given n = 3. 

At first, the three bulbs are [off, off, off].
After first round, the three bulbs are [on, on, on].
After second round, the three bulbs are [on, off, on].
After third round, the three bulbs are [on, off, off]. 

So you should return 1, because there is only one bulb is on.

9. Maximum Product of Word Lengths
Given a string array words, find the maximum value of length(word[i]) * length(word[j]) where the two words do not share common letters. You may assume that each word will contain only lower case letters. If no such two words exist, return 0.
Example 1:
Given ["abcw", "baz", "foo", "bar", "xtfn", "abcdef"]
Return 16
The two words can be "abcw", "xtfn".
