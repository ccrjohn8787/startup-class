  Implement radix sort
  Palindrome pairs
      Given a list of unique words. Find all pairs of distinct indices (i, j) in the given list, so that the concatenation of the two words, i.e. words[i] + words[j] is a palindrome.

  Encode and decode strings
  
  Strobogrammatic number I, II, III
  1. Write a function to determine if a number is strobogrammatic. The number is represented as a string.
  2. Find all strobogrammatic numbers that are of length = n.
  3. Write a function to count the total strobogrammatic numbers that exist in the range of low <= num <= high.
  
  binary tree longest consecutive sequence
  
  insert interval binary search
  
  Minimum window substring
     Given a string S and a string T, find the minimum window in S which will contain all the characters in T in complexity O(n).

  Remove node in BST
  Shortest palindrome
      Given a string S, you are allowed to convert it to a palindrome by adding characters in front of it. Find and return the shortest palindrome you can find by performing this transformation.

  Gray code
     Given a non-negative integer n representing the total number of bits in the code, print the sequence of gray code. A gray code sequence must begin with 0.

  Missing ranges
     Given a sorted integer array where the range of elements are [lower, upper] inclusive, return its missing ranges.For example, given [0, 1, 3, 50, 75], lower = 0 and upper = 99, return ["2", "4->49", "51->74", "76->99"].
 
  Wiggle sort I, II
     1. Given an unsorted array nums, reorder it in-place such that nums[0] <= nums[1] >= nums[2] <= nums[3]....
     2. Given an unsorted array nums, reorder it such that nums[0] < nums[1] > nums[2] < nums[3]....
  
  Binary Tree Vertical order traversal
  
  Generalized Abbreviation
  
  Burst balloon
     Given n balloons, indexed from 0 to n-1. Each balloon is painted with a number on it represented by array nums. You are asked to burst all the balloons. If the you burst balloon i you will get nums[left] * nums[i] * nums[right] coins. Here left and right are adjacent indices of i. After the burst, the left and right then becomes adjacent.
     Find the maximum coins you can collect by bursting the balloons wisely.
  
  Remove duplicate letters
    Given a string which contains only lowercase letters, remove duplicate letters so that every letter appear once and only once. You must make sure your result is the smallest in lexicographical order among all possible results.
  
  Binary tree Max Path Sum
    Given a binary tree, find the maximum path sum.
    For this problem, a path is defined as any sequence of nodes from some starting node to any node in the tree along the parent-child connections. The path does not need to go through the root.
